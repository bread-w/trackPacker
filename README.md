## Description
This application keeps track of the user's digital collection of a user's adventure gear. Users create an account, which they then can add items into their inventory. When users create their excursion, they are able to add into their inventory in that specific excursion. This allows the user to keep track of what they need for all their adventures!

## Installation

This code can be forked and cloned onto one's local device through GitHub. Please make sure you are using the correction applications for administering this code onto your device, such as Terminal and Visual Studio Code. In order to edit the database, the user will need an understanding of MongoDB and an application to keep track of databases, like Robo 3T.

## Usage

The primary usage of this code is to build a digital inventory of excursion items.
